<h1>Introducing: Block Scrapper BSC</h1>

A very sophisticated and robust program built on Python that is capable of seek, find and save from an array of blocks in bscscan.com those transactions that match 2 specific parameters (which are "_PancakeSwap: Router v2_" as _**destiny**_ and a **_BNB Value_** greater than **1**) in a single DataFrame.

This program also prints at the end of its process, the time (format HH:MM:SS.MS) it took to analyze a specific array of blocks, save the desired data and export it as a single DataFrame.

Also, a few csv files are left as sample.

It is expected that this program become very useful in future applications related to investments within decentralized exchanges in public blockchains.

Thanks to **@felipesalda** for his contribution in building this solution.
